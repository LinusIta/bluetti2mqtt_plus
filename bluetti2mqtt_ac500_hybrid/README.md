# Bluetti2MQTT Plus - AC500 Hybrid (v1.0.0-beta1)

**Experimental third Home Assistant add-on**, independent of:
- Bluetti2MQTT Plus 3.0.3 (legacy);
- Bluetti2MQTT Plus - AC500 Secure BLE 4.0.1 (stable).

Do not run the Hybrid add-on at the same time as either existing bridge for the
same AC500 serial number and MQTT topic namespace.

## Transport split

**Modbus TCP / unit ID 1, read-only**: AC output, AC input/grid charging power,
total PV, battery SOC, voltage, current, grid frequency and PV string power.
Registers follow the generated AC500 profile from
[bluetti-community/bluetti-modbus](https://github.com/bluetti-community/bluetti-modbus/blob/main/src/bluetti_modbus_lib/devices/ac500.py).

**Encrypted BLE (bluetti-bt-lib 0.1.8)**: B300 pack SOC/voltage/16 cell values,
remaining settings/diagnostics, and **all device commands** (including
grid_charge_amps, SOC thresholds, output and UPS controls).

Existing MQTT topics and retained Home Assistant Discovery IDs are preserved.
Modbus wins for its mapped fields when fresh; BLE is a fallback when TCP is
unavailable. When Modbus is down, generic BLE polling returns to 15 seconds.
When Modbus is up, BLE generic polling uses poll_sec (120 seconds by default).
B300 scanning retains 600-second interval and hourly full scan.

## Install / configure

From the same GitHub add-on repository select **AC500 Hybrid**.
Stop Secure BLE 4.0.1 first, then configure these settings:

- modbus_host: LAN IP of the AC500 (mandatory for hybrid telemetry)
- modbus_port: 502
- modbus_poll_sec: 5 (2+ seconds supported; start with 5 because another
  Home Assistant Modbus integration is already polling the device)
- bt_mac / device_serial: same as Secure BLE 4.0.1
- MQTT broker and credentials: same as Secure BLE 4.0.1
- allow_writes: true ONLY if you want MQTT commands
- poll_sec: 120 (non-Modbus BLE telemetry; does not delay commands)
- pack_poll_sec: 600, pack_scan_sec: 3600

**Commands are MQTT event driven, not tied to poll_sec**; an ongoing BLE
session or BLE timeout can still delay a command. No real-time latency
guarantee is possible while the BLE session is busy.

## Important beta limitations

- Needs hardware validation on the target AC500 before calling it stable.
- If the AC500 allows a limited number of simultaneous TCP connections,
  temporarily pause the existing Modbus integration during testing.
- The Modbus AC500 profile exposes max pack slots, not necessarily the number
  of installed B300 packs. Per-pack values continue through BLE.
- The Modbus source is read-only by design; do not infer its SOC registers
  are safe for writing.
- The first BLE cold poll may occur before the first Modbus success. MQTT
  consumers must rely on their own staleness checks in case both transports fail.
